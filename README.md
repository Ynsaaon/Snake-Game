# Snake Game
Nostalgia for this classic game in the 90s mobile phone has led me to recreate it and practice my programming skills by using Python's Turtle graphics library which provides a simple way to draw graphics on the screen and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to enhance code organization and maintainability.
